# FocusPing

**Wrong-time notifications stop here.** Context-aware reminders for ADHD adults — a delivery gate, not a day planner.

## Market positioning (research-backed)

Planner apps like Tiimo get praise for visuals but frustrate ADHD users when:
- Reminders fire when you **can't act** (hyperfocus, wrong context)
- Tasks **vanish at midnight** instead of waiting patiently
- **Red overdue badges** and timers feel punishing, not supportive
- Rescheduling incomplete tasks is tedious one-by-one

**FocusPing's wedge:** deliver when you can act. Hold during Focus. Queue without guilt. **"I'm ready"** when *you* choose.

## What's in v1.4

- **App icon & launch screen** — placeholder brand icon installed (replace anytime)
- **Share FocusPing** from Settings
- **Duplicate ping** from long-press menu
- **App Store review prompt** after 8 completed pings (Apple HIG timing)
- **App Store metadata draft** in `AppStore/metadata.md`

## What's in v1.3

### Core differentiator
- **"I'm ready" card** — prominent when pings are queued; one tap delivers all
- **Queue never expires** — held pings stay until you release them

### UX & HIG patterns
- **Search pings** on home tab
- **Undo delete** (5-second banner, no "Are you sure?" dialogs)
- **Delivery window visual** in Settings
- **Help & Tips** sheet explaining the wedge vs planners
- **Onboarding copy** aligned with real user language from App Store reviews

### Previously shipped
- Focus hold, Deep Work, queue, widget, Live Activity
- Siri Shortcuts + home screen quick actions
- Edit pings, snooze (15m–3h), Reminders import
- History (Today / This week / Earlier), privacy manifest
